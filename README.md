# Unix Programs

These are a set of programs in C++ meant to recreate the functionality of common
unix programs. It serves both as a way to learn more C++, as well as better understand 
the programs I use everyday. 

The programs intentionally lack some of the functionality of the originals. 
They contain only the functionality that I use, which keeps the process more 
straight forward and easier to understand.

# 

The collection currently includes:

### Ellis
A recreation of ls. By default it prints with the ls flags -hlN.
It has available flags for print all files (-a), print simple output (-s),
and help (-h). The path can be specified or if blank will be the current directory.
